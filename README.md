# compose-cupertino

This is a fork of [schott12521/compose-cupertino](https://github.com/schott12521/compose-cupertino)

Additionally this repo has automated builds to enable faster releases, to take advantage of new compose multiplatform features as they become available.

## New features (compared to schott12521 `compose-cupertino`)

**Icon Toggle Buttons**
- Added `CupertinoIconToggleButton` and `AdaptiveIconToggleButton` components
- Support for both plain and filled toggle button styles
- Icon button size variants (Large, Medium, Small) matching iOS guidelines

**Enhanced Icon Button Architecture**
- New `IconSource` interface supporting Vector, Painter, and Bitmap icons
- Refactored icon button implementation with better press feedback
- Improved `PlainButtonIndication` system

**UIKit Integration Support**
- Added `hasUIKitContent` flag to `CupertinoScaffold` and related components
- Added `hasUIKitContent` flag to `AdaptiveScaffold` cupertino adaptation
- Disables translucent haze/blur effects when using native UIKit views on iOS to prevents rendering issues when embedding UIKit content in Compose

### Technical Improvements

**Build System Updates:**
- Gradle: Updated to 9.0.0
- Kotlin: Updated to 2.2.10
- Android target SDK: Updated to 36
- Compose and other dependencies updated to latest versions
