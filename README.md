# compose-cupertino

This is a fork of [schott12521/compose-cupertino](https://github.com/schott12521/compose-cupertino)

Additionally this repo has automated builds to enable faster releases, to take advantage of new compose multiplatform features as they become available.

## New features (compared to the OG `compose-cupertino`)

- Updated SwipeBox
- Fixed Cupertino Date Picker implementations to interact with scrolling correctly
- Disable content scaling on CupertinoBottomSheetScaffold (https://github.com/alexzhirkevich/compose-cupertino/issues/80)
- Using Dialogs instead of Popups for CupertinoDialogs (https://github.com/alexzhirkevich/compose-cupertino/issues/78)

# Usage

This package is published to Maven Central Repository: [cupertino-core on Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/artifact/io.github.robinpcrd/cupertino-core)

Depend on the [latest version](https://github.com/robinpcrd/compose-cupertino/releases) by declaring this in libs.versions.toml:

```
cupertino = "$latestVersion"

cupertino = { group = "io.github.robinpcrd", name = "cupertino", version.ref = "cupertino" }
cupertino-adaptive = { group = "io.github.robinpcrd", name = "cupertino-adaptive", version.ref = "cupertino" }
cupertino-decompose = { group = "io.github.robinpcrd", name = "cupertino-decompose", version.ref = "cupertino" }
cupertino-native = { group = "io.github.robinpcrd", name = "cupertino-native", version.ref = "cupertino" }
cupertino-icons-extended = { group = "io.github.robinpcrd", name = "cupertino-icons-extended", version.ref = "cupertino" }
```
